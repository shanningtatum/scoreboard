A personal project that I did for Perplexity Escape Games using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Google Firebase.

With the help of my colleagues, I collected the escape room data from December 2021 onwards using Google Forms and Google Sheets. The form kept track of the date, room names, the number of players, the number of hints they used, whether or not they completed the room and the time it did take for them to complete the room. 

This was to keep an accurate analysis of the room's passrates but also to help determine where each room falls short (are players not completing it? How far do they usually get before they run out of time?) to find solutions to improve the user experience.

Once enough data was collected, I entered the entries into Google's Firebase to use as a database and created a website that displays the data. Employees can now use the website to log the entries and see the most recent stats. 

It is still being worked on but you can check out the live site <a href="https://peg-leaderboard.netlify.app/">here</a>
